Okay, let's refine the project document to build an Optimized Core designed *from the start* with the *future goal* of <5ms latency and $40k+/day potential, while remaining practical and cost-effective for the initial $400-$800/day target using standard infrastructure.

This means incorporating architectural elements crucial for low latency (like an in-memory cache) *now*, even if they aren't strictly necessary for the initial profit target, because retrofitting them later would be much harder.

## REVISED V4: PROJECT_FEASIBILITY_SCALABLE_CORE.md

**Objective:** This document outlines the plan for the ULP 1.5 cross-DEX arbitrage bot, focusing on building a **Scalable Core system**. This system is designed for initial deployment on standard cloud infrastructure targeting **$400 - $800 / day** profit, but its architecture explicitly incorporates patterns and optimizations necessary for future upgrades targeting **<5ms latency** and **$40k+/day** potential with enhanced infrastructure (e.g., co-location). Local simulation via Anvil remains a cornerstone for development and testing.

## 1. Project Goal (Scalable Core)

Develop an efficient, reliable, and **highly scalable** arbitrage system (**ULP 1.5 Scalable Core**) for L2 execution.

*   **Phase 1 Goal:** Achieve an average daily profit of **$400 - $800 USD** using Balancer V2 0-fee flash loans ($10k - $500k range) on standard cloud infrastructure. Execute primarily 2-way arbitrage paths across key DEXs (UniV3, VeloV2).
*   **Phase 2 Goal (Enabled by Architecture):** Scale towards **$40k - $100k+ USD** average daily profit by leveraging the core architecture with infrastructure upgrades (co-location/direct data feeds for <5ms latency), advanced multi-hop routing (potentially RouteGraph), and significantly larger flash loan capital ($1M - $5M+).

The core Rust application and Huff contract will be architected from the start to support the transition to Phase 2 performance requirements without fundamental rewrites.

## 2. Profit Target Feasibility Analysis (Scalable Core)

### 2.1 Arguments For Feasibility (Phase 1: $400 - $800 / day):

*   **L2 Advantages:** Low fees, faster blocks, DEX inefficiencies persist.
*   **0-Fee Loans:** Crucial for making smaller spreads viable with moderate capital.
*   **Optimized Software Core:** Efficient Rust code, `DashMap` state, fast in-memory cache lookups (see Architecture), optimized simulation, and gas-efficient Huff contract provide a solid performance baseline even on standard infrastructure.
*   **Essential MEV Protection:** Using private transaction submission (Protect/MEV-Share) from day one significantly improves execution reliability and profitability compared to public-only bots.
*   **Moderate Loan Size:** $10k-$500k avoids excessive slippage, increasing the number of executable opportunities in diverse pools.
*   **Local Simulation:** Allows rigorous testing before deployment.

### 2.2 Arguments For Feasibility (Phase 2: $40k+ / day):

*   **Scalable Architecture:** The core design anticipates future needs:
    *   **In-Memory Cache:** Allows sub-millisecond state lookups, critical for <5ms total latency.
    *   **Modular Components:** Data sources, pathfinders, and transaction submitters can be upgraded independently.
    *   **Huff Efficiency:** Remains vital for minimizing on-chain execution gas/time.
    *   **Private Tx:** Foundational for large, profitable trades.
*   **Infrastructure Upgrade Path:** The plan explicitly includes co-location/direct node feeds as the key enabler for ultra-low latency required at this scale.
*   **Market Opportunity:** While challenging, large, fleeting opportunities ($5k-$10k+ profit) *do* occur, especially during high volatility or across less efficient DEX pairs. Capturing these requires the speed and capital this architecture enables in Phase 2.

### 2.3 Challenges & Risks:

*   **Phase 1:**
    *   **Competition:** The mid-range is crowded. Efficiency and reliability are key differentiators.
    *   **Latency (Standard Cloud):** ~50-150ms latency limits capture rate. Success depends on finding slightly longer-duration spreads.
    *   **Infrastructure Reliability:** Public RPCs/standard VPS can have interruptions.
*   **Phase 2:**
    *   **Extreme Competition:** Competing directly with highly optimized MEV searchers and institutional players.
    *   **Latency is King:** Achieving and *maintaining* a <5ms edge is technically demanding and costly. Requires continuous optimization.
    *   **Execution & MEV Risk:** Even private bundles aren't foolproof. Large trades are prime MEV targets. Sophisticated strategies (e.g., multi-block MEV) exist.
    *   **Capital & Slippage:** Deploying $5M+ effectively requires deep liquidity and sophisticated slippage management/prediction.
    *   **Infrastructure Costs & Complexity:** Co-location, private networking, high-throughput nodes are expensive and require expertise.
    *   **Strategy Decay:** Constant R&D needed to find new edges as markets adapt.

### 2.4 Feasibility Verdict (Scalable Core):

*   **Phase 1 ($400 - $800 / day):** **Feasible and Realistic.** The Scalable Core architecture, even on standard infrastructure, provides the necessary efficiency and MEV protection to achieve this target consistently.
*   **Phase 2 ($40k+ / day):** **Challenging but Architecturally Enabled.** Reaching this level is *not guaranteed* and depends heavily on successfully implementing the Phase 2 infrastructure upgrades (achieving <5ms) and potentially more advanced routing/MEV strategies. However, the Scalable Core architecture *is designed* to make this transition possible without starting over. It builds the right foundation *now*.

## 4. Project Structure & Workflow (Scalable Core)

### 4.1 Components:

*   **On-Chain (`ArbitrageExecutor.huff`):** Optimized for gas, handles 2-way swaps initially (extensible). Includes `minProfitWei` check loaded from `userData`.
*   **Off-Chain (Rust Bot - `ulp1_5` binary):**
    *   **Core Modules:** `main.rs`, `config.rs`, `bindings.rs`, `gas.rs`, `encoding.rs`, `deploy.rs`, `utils.rs`.
    *   **`state.rs` (New/Refined):**
        *   Defines `AppState` struct.
        *   Contains `Arc<DashMap<Address, PoolState>>` (raw pool data).
        *   Contains `Arc<DashMap<Address, PoolSnapshot>>` (**In-Memory Hot-Cache**). `PoolSnapshot` holds minimal, frequently accessed data (price/reserves, tokens, dex type). Updated by `event_handler`.
    *   **`event_handler.rs`:** Listens to WS events. **Primary role:** Decode events and *rapidly update the In-Memory Hot-Cache (`PoolSnapshot`)*. Spawns `check_for_arbitrage` task non-blockingly.
    *   **`path_optimizer.rs`:**
        *   Operates **exclusively** on the **In-Memory Hot-Cache (`PoolSnapshot` map)** for speed.
        *   Performs efficient 2-way route identification based on cached prices/reserves.
        *   Generates `RouteCandidate` list.
    *   **`simulation.rs`:** Simulates routes identified by `path_optimizer`, calculates gross profit and optimal loan size. *May still require RPC calls for accurate quotes via DEX Routers/Quoters if cache isn't sufficient for simulation.*
    *   **`transaction.rs`:** Constructs transactions, adds `minProfitWei` to `userData`, manages gas/nonces, handles **private submission** logic with public fallback.
    *   **`local_simulator.rs` (Optional):** Helpers for Anvil testing.

### 4.2 Workflow (Scalable Core):

1.  **Initialization:** Load config, connect RPCs (incl. private), init `AppState` (incl. empty Hot-Cache), fetch initial pool states & **populate both `PoolState` raw map and `PoolSnapshot` hot-cache**, deploy/load executor, subscribe to WS events. Log 0 Balancer fee confirmation.
2.  **Event Loop:** Process WS events.
3.  **Event Handling:** On `Swap`: Decode event, **update `PoolSnapshot` hot-cache for the specific pool**, spawn `check_for_arbitrage` task. On `PoolCreated`: Add pool to both maps.
4.  **Arbitrage Check (`check_for_arbitrage` -> `find_top_routes`):**
    *   Read updated pool's snapshot from **hot-cache**.
    *   Iterate through relevant entries in the **hot-cache**.
    *   Compare cached prices/reserves.
    *   Identify pairs exceeding threshold based *only* on cached data.
    *   Generate and sort `RouteCandidate` list.
5.  **Simulation & Optimization (`find_optimal_loan_amount`):**
    *   For top candidate(s), spawn simulation task:
        *   Fetch current gas price dynamically.
        *   **Crucially:** Use DEX Quoter/Router RPC calls (`simulate_swap`) for *accurate* amount out predictions during loan optimization, as the hot-cache might not be precise enough for simulation across different amounts.
        *   Estimate gas cost.
        *   Calculate net profit = Gross Profit - Gas Cost.
        *   Find optimal loan amount & max profit. Calculate `minProfitWei` threshold.
6.  **Execution (`transaction.rs`):**
    *   If profitable: Encode `userData` (with `minProfitWei`), construct tx, submit via **private endpoint**, monitor.
7.  **On-Chain Execution (`ArbitrageExecutor.huff`):** Executes swaps, checks against `minProfitWei`, approves/reverts.
8.  **Profit Withdrawal:** Manual.
9.  **Local Simulation Workflow:** As described previously, using Anvil forks for testing the full loop.
10. **Competitor Latency Monitoring:** Periodically use `cast block --rpc-url YOUR_RPC` (or equivalent method) during operation, especially after submitting a transaction, to observe block construction and estimate if your transaction was included quickly or potentially frontrun/sandwiched by others appearing in the same block. Correlate with logs of submitted vs confirmed trades.

## 5. Key Success Factors (Scalable Core)

*   **Efficient Cache Management:** Keeping the hot-cache (`PoolSnapshot`) updated quickly and accurately is critical.
*   **Fast Pathfinding (Cache-based):** `path_optimizer` must be rapid using only cached data.
*   **Accurate Simulation:** `simulation.rs` needs correct DEX interaction logic (via RPC) despite pathfinding using cache.
*   **Reliable Private Submission:** Essential for protecting profit.
*   **Gas Efficiency:** Huff and transaction parameters.
*   **Robust Testing:** Extensive local simulation.

## 6. Revised MU2 Sequence (Scalable Core Focus)

1.  **MU2.1 - Core State & Cache:** Implement `state.rs` with `AppState`, `PoolState`, `PoolSnapshot`. Implement `event_handler` to update the `PoolSnapshot` cache rapidly. Fetch initial state populating both maps. Basic Anvil testing setup. **Goal:** Efficient in-memory state representation updated by events.
2.  **MU2.2 - Pathfinding & Simulation:** Implement `path_optimizer` to work *off the cache*. Implement `simulation` (using RPCs for quotes). Integrate `event_handler` -> `path_optimizer` -> `simulation` task spawning. **Goal:** Bot identifies and accurately simulates opportunities based on cached triggers and RPC quotes.
3.  **MU2.3 - Huff v2 (`minProfitWei`) & Private Transactions:** Refine Huff contract with `minProfitWei` check. Implement `transaction.rs` with private endpoint submission + fallback, dynamic gas/nonce management, `minProfitWei` encoding. **Goal:** Bot can securely construct and submit profitable transactions.
4.  **MU2.4 - Deployment, Monitoring & Basic DEX Expansion:** Deploy to cloud VPS. Set up monitoring (logs, uptime, balance, front-run monitoring). Add support for 1-2 Velo-style DEXs. **Goal:** Bot runs reliably, executes trades, handles >2 DEXs.
5.  **MU2.5+ (Phase 2 Prep):** Performance analysis, bottleneck identification (is network latency the issue?), potential infrastructure upgrades (co-location), advanced routing, capital scaling.
