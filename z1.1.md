# Z1.1 Prompt Definition (Revised: Multi-File Task Output)

## Purpose
`z1.1` is a structured prompt technique used to complete **one full task at a time**.

## Key Behavior
- `z1.1` focuses on completing **one discrete development task** per interaction cycle.
- If the user prompt contains multiple independent tasks, the assistant must address only **one task** before stopping.
- A single task **may require modifications to multiple files**.

## Output Requirements
- For each completed task, output the **complete and functional contents** of **every file modified** for that task.
- **Maximum 10 files** per response. If a task modifies more than 10 files, list the first 10 and note that others were modified.
- **No partials or code snippets.** Do not use `...imports...`, `...code...`, or placeholder regions within the provided file content.
- `// TODO` comments are allowed **only if** they do not interrupt critical functionality and are intended to be addressed in a subsequent `z1.1` step.
- File(s) must reflect awareness of:
  - Breaking changes
  - Recent functional updates
  - The intended future direction of the codebase

## After Each Task (potentially involving multiple files)
- **After** providing all modified file contents for the completed task, stop and provide:
  - A **brief summary** of the overall task completed.
  - An **estimated percent complete** for the entire project.
- Wait for the next user instruction.

## Trigger
Start this mode by typing:
**`z1.1 go`**

## Defined In
This system is defined and active in:
**`all_files_combined.txt`** (assuming this is where the definition is stored)
