# Z1.1 Prompt for Google AI Studio

> **Purpose:**  
> `z1.1` is a structured prompt technique for delivering code one complete file at a time in a consistent, modular, and version-aware way.

> **Flow:**  
> - When I type **"z1.1 go"**, you begin the process.  
> - You will analyze the current state of the project (from provided files, context, or change history).  
> - Based on this, deliver the **next complete and functional file**:
>   - Do **not** send snippets, fragments, or partials (e.g., `...imports...` is not acceptable).  
>   - Each file should be structurally sound and ready for integration.  
>   - `// TODO` comments are allowed **only if you remember to return and resolve them** in later iterations.
> - After each file:
>   - **Stop** and provide a **short summary** of what was delivered.
>   - Include an **estimated percent complete** for the overall project based on total file count or major feature milestones.

> **Requirements:**  
> - Be mindful of **breaking changes**.
> - Incorporate awareness of **recent functional changes** and **future direction**.
> - Prioritize functional completeness and consistency across the codebase.

> **Trigger Command:**  
> Type **"z1.1 go"** to begin this process.
