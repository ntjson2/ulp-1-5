# Z1.1 Prompt Definition (Updated)

## Purpose
`z1.1` is a structured prompt technique used to complete **one full task at a time**, delivering **a complete, functional file** as output for each task.

## Key Behavior
- `z1.1` is **task-based**, not just file-based.
- If the user prompt contains multiple changes or instructions, the assistant must:
  - Identify and complete only **one task** at a time.
  - Output a single **complete and functional file** for that task.
  - Stop and wait for further instructions.

## Output Requirements
- **No partials or code snippets.**
  - Do not use `...imports...`, `...code...`, or placeholder regions.
- `// TODO` comments are allowed **only if** they do not interrupt critical functionality and will be returned to in a future step.
- File must reflect awareness of:
  - Breaking changes
  - Recent functional updates
  - The intended future direction of the codebase

## After Each File
- Stop and provide:
  - A **brief summary** of what was completed
  - An **estimated percent complete** for the overall project

## Trigger
Start this mode by typing:  
**`z1.1 go`**

## Defined In
This system is defined and active in:  
**`all_files_combined.txt`**
