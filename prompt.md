# ULP 1.5 Arbitrage Bot - Project Context Transfer (2025-05-12 Update)

## 1. Purpose of this Prompt

This prompt provides the necessary context and instructions to continue development on the ULP 1.5 Arbitrage Bot project. You are taking over from a previous session. Your primary goal is to understand the project's current state, goals, code structure, and established development workflows (`z1.1` and `j9` protocols) based on the information herein and the accompanying `all_files_combined.txt` file.

**Prioritize the instructions and definitions within *this* `prompt.md` file.** The `all_files_combined.txt` file contains the project's code history, previous notes, and older protocol definitions, which should be used as reference and context, but superseded by this document where definitions conflict (especially for `z1.1`).

## 2. Project Overview

*   **Goal:** Develop a high-performance arbitrage bot (ULP 1.5) capable of executing flash loan-based arbitrage opportunities across Layer 2 DEXs (initially focusing on Uniswap V3 and Velodrome V2 / Aerodrome style pools on Optimism/Base).
*   **Core Strategy:** Utilize Balancer V2 flash loans as the capital source and a custom, gas-optimized Huff contract (`ArbitrageExecutor.huff`) for atomic execution of the arbitrage (swap A -> swap B -> repay loan + profit check).
*   **Key Technologies:** Rust, Tokio, ethers-rs, Huff, Balancer V2, Uniswap V3, Velodrome V2 / Aerodrome.

## 3. Input Files Provided

You will receive the following *after* this prompt:

1.  `all_files_combined.txt`: Contains the complete source code for all relevant project files (`.rs`, `.huff`, `Cargo.toml`, `.env` (template), `README.md`, etc.), concatenated together. It also contains historical notes, previous prompt definitions, and status updates. **Use this primarily for code reference and historical context.**
2.  `prompt.md` (This file): Contains the **current** instructions, protocol definitions, status, and goals. **This file takes precedence over definitions found in `all_files_combined.txt`.**

**Action:** Process both this `prompt.md` and the contents of `all_files_combined.txt` to build your understanding of the project.

## 4. Development Workflow Protocols

All development **must** follow one of the two protocols defined below:

---

### 4.1. `z1.1` Protocol (Revised: Multi-File Task Output)

*   **Purpose:** Complete **one full task** at a time. A task might involve creating a new feature, refactoring a module, updating documentation, implementing a test, etc.
*   **Behavior:**
    *   Focuses on completing **one discrete development task** per interaction cycle.
    *   If the user prompt contains multiple independent tasks, address only **one task** before stopping.
    *   A single task **may require modifications to multiple files**.
*   **Output Requirements:**
    *   For each completed task, output the **complete and functional contents** of **every file modified** for that task.
    *   **Maximum 10 files** per response. If a task modifies more than 10 files, list the first 10 and note that others were modified.
    *   **No partials or code snippets.** Do not use `...imports...`, `...code...`, etc.
    *   `// TODO` comments are allowed only if non-critical and planned for a future step.
    *   Reflect awareness of breaking changes, recent updates, and project direction.
*   **After Each Task (Outputting 1 to 10 Files):**
    *   Stop and provide:
        *   A **brief summary** of the overall task completed.
        *   An **estimated percent complete** for the entire project.
    *   Wait for the next user instruction.
*   **Trigger:** User types **`z1.1 go`**.

---

### 4.2. `j9` Protocol (Error Correction)

*   **Purpose:** Fix compilation errors reported by `cargo check`, `cargo build`, or `cargo test`.
*   **Trigger:** User provides the complete compiler error output and the command **`j9 go`**.
*   **Action:** Analyze errors, determine fixes for **all** reported errors in the batch.
*   **Output:** Return the **complete contents** of **every file** modified (up to 10 files per response) to fix the errors.
*   **Per-File Summary:** *After* the code block for *each* modified file, stop and provide:
    *   `File Updated: [path/to/filename.ext]`
    *   `Task Summary: [Brief description of fixes applied *within that specific file* for the current error batch.]`
*   **Overall Batch Summary:** After all modified files and their summaries, provide:
    *   `Estimated Percent Complete (Current Batch): [Percentage for fixing the current set of errors.]`
*   **Wait:** Wait for the user to run the check/build/test again or provide further instructions.

## 5. Current Project Status (as of 2025-05-12)

*   **Core Logic & Structure:**
    *   The project is structured as a Rust library (`bot/src/lib.rs`) and a binary (`bot/src/main.rs`).
    *   Modules for `config`, `bindings`, `state`, `event_handler`, `path_optimizer`, `simulation`, `transaction`, `gas`, `encoding`, `deploy`, and `utils` are implemented.
    *   `ArbitrageExecutor.huff` is complete and compiles.
*   **Local Simulation Testing (`tests/integration_test.rs` with Anvil):**
    *   **`test_setup`:** Verifies Anvil connection, executor deployment, and includes diagnostic calls to Uniswap V3 QuoterV2 and the Velodrome V2 Router implementation (using a hardcoded address due to Anvil proxy issues). This test currently passes.
    *   **`test_swap_triggers`:** Tests helper functions for triggering swaps on Anvil (UniV3 via SwapRouter, VeloV2 via direct pool call).
    *   **`test_full_univ3_arbitrage_cycle`:** Successfully tests the end-to-end flow for UniV3 -> UniV3 arbitrage. It uses real QuoterV2 calls for simulation. Due to potential lack of real profit on forked state and RPC rate limits, `OPTIMAL_LOAN_SEARCH_ITERATIONS` is reduced (e.g., to 2) in `.env` for this test, and a "fake profit" is injected if no real profit is found, allowing the transaction submission logic to be tested. This test passes and successfully submits a transaction to Anvil.
    *   **`test_full_arbitrage_cycle_simulation` (UniV3 -> VeloV2):** This test also runs end-to-end. Due to persistent Anvil fork state inconsistencies with the Velodrome Router/Factory, `simulate_swap` for Velodrome V2 calls the router implementation directly and, if that fails (e.g., with `PairDoesNotExist`), falls back to a rough estimation. The "fake profit" injection is also used here. This test passes by design, testing the mechanics even with the Velo simulation workaround.
    *   **`test_event_handling_triggers_arbitrage_check`:**
        *   **Current State:** This test has been implemented. It deploys a `MinimalSwapEmitter.sol` contract, triggers a synthetic `Swap` event from it, modifies the log's address to appear as if it came from a real Uniswap V3 pool, and passes it to `handle_log_event`.
        *   **Assertions:** It asserts that the `PoolSnapshot` for the target UniV3 pool is correctly updated by `handle_log_event`.
        *   **Known Anvil Issue:** The `fetch_and_cache_pool_state` for the *real* UniV3 pool (used to get an initial snapshot) still relies on a fallback mechanism due to Anvil's difficulty in fetching state for specific UniV3 pool contracts directly. This part of the test uses the fallback.
        *   This test currently passes, validating the event handling logic up to the point of snapshot update.
*   **Workarounds for Anvil Issues:**
    *   `bot/src/state.rs` (`fetch_and_cache_pool_state`): For `local_simulation`, if direct UniV3 pool view calls fail, it falls back to plausible default/hardcoded values to allow tests to proceed.
    *   `bot/src/simulation.rs` (`simulate_swap`): For `local_simulation` with `VelodromeV2`, it first attempts to call the hardcoded router *implementation* address. If that call fails (e.g., with `PairDoesNotExist`), it falls back to a very rough output estimation to prevent tests from hanging.
    *   `bot/src/simulation.rs` (`find_optimal_loan_amount`): For `local_simulation`, if no actual profitable loan amount is found after simulations, it injects a small, fake positive profit to allow testing of the downstream transaction submission logic.
*   **Configuration:** `OPTIMAL_LOAN_SEARCH_ITERATIONS` in `.env` is currently reduced (e.g., to 2) to avoid RPC rate limits during local Anvil testing.
*   **Compilation:** Project compiles successfully (`cargo check`, `cargo test` for compiled modules). Unused import warnings are minor.
*   **Estimated Overall Completion:** ~95% (Core UniV3 path and event handling validated locally. Velo path has workarounds for local sim. Main remaining gap is full WS loop testing).

## 6. Key Files Overview (Same as before, for context)

*   `bot/src/main.rs`: Main entry point, event loop, provider setup.
*   `bot/src/lib.rs`: Library root, defines public modules and items.
*   `bot/src/config.rs`: Loads configuration from `.env`.
*   `bot/src/state.rs`: Defines `AppState`, `PoolState`, `PoolSnapshot`, `DexType`. Handles state fetching/caching.
*   `bot_src/event_handler.rs`: Processes incoming block/log events, updates state, triggers arbitrage checks.
*   `bot/src/path_optimizer.rs`: Finds potential arbitrage routes based on cached snapshots.
*   `bot/src/simulation.rs`: Simulates route profitability off-chain, finds optimal loan amount.
*   `bot/src/transaction.rs`: Constructs, signs, submits, and monitors arbitrage transactions. Includes `NonceManager`.
*   `bot/src/local_simulator.rs`: Framework for interacting with local Anvil fork (used by tests).
*   `tests/integration_test.rs`: Integration tests using Anvil.
*   `contracts/ArbitrageExecutor.huff`: Huff implementation of the flash loan executor.
*   `contracts/MinimalSwapEmitter.sol`: Solidity contract for emitting synthetic Swap events for testing.
*   `abis/`: Directory containing JSON ABI files for bindings.
*   `Cargo.toml`: Project dependencies and features.
*   `.env` (template): User-specific configuration.

## 7. Current Task Scope & Next Steps

*   **Current Task (Completed in previous interaction):** Successfully implemented `test_event_handling_triggers_arbitrage_check` using a synthetic event emitter (`MinimalSwapEmitter.sol`). This test verifies that `handle_log_event` correctly processes a (modified) synthetic `Swap` log and updates the relevant `PoolSnapshot` in `AppState`.
*   **Immediate Next Steps (for this new session):**
    1.  **Clean Up Warnings:** Address the `unused import: Bytes` warning in `bot/src/simulation.rs` and any other minor unused import warnings flagged by the last `cargo test` run.
    2.  **Enhance `test_event_handling_triggers_arbitrage_check` (Verification of `check_for_arbitrage`):**
        *   The current test confirms snapshot updates. The next step is to verify that `check_for_arbitrage` is indeed spawned and attempts to find routes.
        *   **Strategy:** Modify `event_handler::check_for_arbitrage` slightly. If the `local_simulation` feature is enabled, instead of directly spawning `tokio::task` for `find_optimal_loan_amount` and `submit_arbitrage_transaction`, it could send a message via a `tokio::sync::mpsc::channel` or set a flag in a test-specific field within `AppState` if routes are found. The test would then await this message or check this flag. This makes the "triggering" aspect more directly assertable without full execution. This might involve passing the sender part of the channel into `check_for_arbitrage` or `AppState`.
    3.  **Test Main Event Loop with WS (More Complex):**
        *   Design a test that initializes the main bot components (`AppState`, `Client`, `NonceManager`, event filters).
        *   Starts a *mocked* version of the main event loop from `main.rs` (or a simplified test-specific loop) that subscribes to Anvil's Websocket stream.
        *   The test would then trigger a swap (using `MinimalSwapEmitter` or `trigger_v3_swap_via_router` if Anvil state for a pool becomes reliable) on Anvil.
        *   Assert that the test's event loop receives the event via its WS subscription and correctly calls `handle_log_event`, leading to snapshot updates (and the test-specific signal from `check_for_arbitrage` if implemented as above).

*   **Lower Priority / Future:**
    *   Address Anvil state inconsistencies for Velodrome V2 (e.g., by exploring Anvil updates, different RPCs for forking, or the `--code` override if Anvil versioning permits it later).
    *   Implement accurate UniV3 dynamic loan sizing.
    *   Add support for more DEXs.
    *   Develop deployment scripts/configuration.
