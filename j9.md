**Revised `j9` Protocol:**

1.  **Trigger:** User provides `cargo check` (or `cargo build`/`cargo test`) error output and the command **"j9 go"**.
2.  **Action:** Assistant analyzes errors, researches solutions, and determines fixes for **all** reported errors.
3.  **Output:** Assistant returns the **complete contents** of **every file** modified (up to a maximum of 10 files per response). Each file's content will be clearly marked.
4.  **Per-File Summary:** *After* the code block for *each* modified file, the assistant provides:
    *   `File Updated: [path/to/filename.ext]`
    *   `Task Summary: [Brief description of fixes applied *within that specific file* for the current error batch.]`
5.  **Overall Batch Summary:** After all modified files and their summaries, the assistant provides:
    *   `Estimated Percent Complete (Current Batch): [Percentage for fixing the current set of errors.]`
6.  **Wait:** Assistant waits for the next user instruction (e.g., re-run check/test).
