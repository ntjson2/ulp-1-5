# J9 Prompt for Google AI Studio (Strict Version)

> **Purpose:**  
> j9 is a structured error-fixing technique designed for full-file corrections after Rust `cargo check` outputs, ensuring maximum reliability and project momentum.

> **Flow:**  
> - I will provide a **`cargo check`** error output.  
> - You must:
>   - Analyze carefully and **research deeply**.
>   - **Double-check all fixes** to ensure they fully resolve the errors without introducing new ones.
>   - **Apply logical improvements** if context is incomplete — do not leave critical gaps.
> - Return **All corrected files**:
>   - No partial files, no `...imports...` placeholders.
>   - Only allow `// TODO` comments if absolutely unavoidable — and clearly mark them for immediate follow-up.  
> - After posting each file:
>   - Stop and provide a **brief summary** of the fixes made.
>   - Estimate the **percent complete** for the overall project error fixing.
> - Wait for me to run **`cargo check`** again and supply the next error output.
> 
> **Requirements:**  
> - Fix with **production-level caution**.
> - Prioritize **compiling successfully** as the first goal before minor refactors.
> - Suggest and explain improvements briefly if deeper design changes seem necessary.

> **Trigger Command:**  
> When I type **"j9 go"**, begin this flow.
