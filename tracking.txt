ULP 1.5 Arbitrage Bot - Project Transfer. Study attached all_files_combined.txt
Update and give me complete, updated and whole files of: PROJECT_FEASIBILITY.md, PROJECT_LOG.md and prompt.md according 
with new and updated current project state and future direction, be detailed and accurate. Make sure in PROJECT_DIRECTION_LOG you clearly outline in 
detail the current task we are currently working on, complete with what just occured, what needs to be met and where the next steps are.

Give me advice on a way to start a process where when I run the run_me.sh script (in a vs code wsl terminal) and prompt you "p1 go", that you take the results somehow output to resuls.txt, fix the errors with code file edits, rerun run_me.sh repeatedly until the errors are fixed? Some kind of .bat file with "run_me.sh" in a loop? other?

**Current Issue (j9.1):**
The script `p1_loop.sh` fails to execute in WSL with the error: `/usr/bin/env: ‘bash\r’: No such file or directory`.
This is caused by Windows CRLF line endings in the script file. Linux/WSL expects LF line endings. The `\r` is being treated as part of the interpreter name.

**Solution:**
1. Convert line endings of `p1_loop.sh` from CRLF to LF.
   - In WSL, run: `dos2unix p1_loop.sh`
   - (If `dos2unix` is not installed: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dos2unix`)
   - Alternatively, open `p1_loop.sh` in a text editor like VS Code, change line endings to LF, and save.
2. After fixing line endings, try running `./p1_loop.sh` again.

**Further Troubleshooting for `./p1_loop.sh` execution (if `bash\r` or permission errors persist):**

User is asking if an environment variable is needed to run `./p1_loop.sh`. This is unlikely for the `bash\r` error.

1.  **Re-confirm Line Endings for `p1_loop.sh`**:
    *   The error `/usr/bin/env: ‘bash\r’: No such file or directory` is almost certainly due to Windows CRLF line endings.
    *   In WSL, ensure `dos2unix p1_loop.sh` has been run successfully.

2.  **Set Execute Permissions for `p1_loop.sh`**:
    *   The script needs execute permission to run.
    *   In WSL, run: `chmod +x p1_loop.sh`

3.  **Check `run_me.sh` (called by `p1_loop.sh`)**:
    *   Apply `dos2unix` and `chmod +x` to `run_me.sh` as well, as `p1_loop.sh` needs to execute it:
        *   `dos2unix run_me.sh`
        *   `chmod +x run_me.sh`

4.  **Attempt to run again**:
    *   `./p1_loop.sh`

**Update (User executed steps):**
User successfully installed `dos2unix`, converted `p1_loop.sh` and `run_me.sh` using `dos2unix`, and set execute permissions for `p1_loop.sh` using `chmod +x p1_loop.sh`.

The command `p1_loop.sh` resulted in `p1_loop.sh: command not found`.

**Solution for "command not found":**
To execute a script located in the current directory, you must prefix its name with `./`. This tells the shell to look for the script in the current location.

Correct command to run the script:
```bash
./p1_loop.sh
```

If errors still occur, note the exact new error message.

**Regarding the automated loop for `run_me.sh` and AI fixes:**
The `p1_loop.sh` script you have already implements the first part: running `run_me.sh`, capturing output to `results.txt`, and looping.
The part about "fix the errors with code file edits, rerun run_me.sh repeatedly until the errors are fixed" by the AI automatically is a complex task. Currently, the loop is designed for you to manually provide `results.txt` to the AI (me), get suggestions, apply them, and then re-run the script. Fully automating the AI's code correction and re-running is beyond a simple script and would require a more sophisticated setup, potentially involving APIs and custom tooling. For now, the `p1_loop.sh` facilitates the manual iteration.

Research project, especially project spec files, PROJECT_FEASIBILITY.md, PROJECT_DIRECTION_LOG.md and prompt.md.
