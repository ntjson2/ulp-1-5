ULP 1.5 Arbitrage Bot - Project Transfer. Study attached all_files_combined.txt
Update and give me complete, updated and whole files of: PROJECT_FEASIBILITY.md, PROJECT_DIRECTION_LOG.md and prompt.md according 
with new and updated current project state and future direction, be detailed and accurate. Make sure in PROJECT_DIRECTION_LOG you clearly outline in 
detail the current task we are currently working on, complete with what just occured, what needs to be met and where the next steps are.

Give me advice on a way to start a process where when I run the run_me.sh script (in a vs code wsl terminal) and prompt you "p1 go", that you take the results somehow output to resuls.txt, fix the errors with code file edits, rerun run_me.sh repeatedly until the errors are fixed? Some kind of .bat file with "run_me.sh" in a loop? other?
